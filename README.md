Hello, I just wanted to do a little introduction of myself. 

Since I was a kid, technology has always been a big part of my life. I remember building my first computer together
and it was such a enjoyable experience. That experience paved the way into software development. I can still 
remember the first time I printed out "hello world!" on C++. 

This is still my main passion today. Here at the University of Illinois Chicago, I get to learn new languages, algorithms,
and build projects in my classes and use those new skills to implement into my own personal projects. 

Now as I look forward to graduation, I started learning how to use HTML, JavaScript, and other languages to bring my
skills to the next level as I hope to move on to companies that are interested into what I have to offer.

Specialties: C, C++, Python
